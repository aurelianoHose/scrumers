scrum.value=<div><p>Scrum is an iterative and incremental agile software development methodology for managing product development. It defines "a flexible, holistic product development strategy where a development team works as a unit to reach a common goal", challenges assumptions of the "traditional, sequential approach" to product development, and enables teams to self-organize by encouraging physical co-location or close online collaboration of all team members, as well as daily face-to-face communication among all team members and disciplines in the project.</p><p>A key principle of scrum is its recognition that during a project the customers can change their minds about what they want and need (often called "requirements churn"), and that unpredicted challenges cannot be easily addressed in a traditional predictive or planned manner. As such, scrum adopts an empirical approach\u2014accepting that the problem cannot be fully understood or defined, focusing instead on maximizing the team's ability to deliver quickly and respond to emerging requirements.</p><p>Scrum was first defined as "a flexible, holistic product development strategy where a development team works as a unit to reach a common goal" as opposed to a "traditional, sequential approach" in 1986 by Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka in the New New Product Development Game. Takeuchi and Nonaka later argued in The Knowledge Creating Company that it is a form of "organizational knowledge creation, [...] especially good at bringing about innovation continuously, incrementally and spirally".</p><p>The authors described a new approach to commercial product development that would increase speed and flexibility, based on case studies from manufacturing firms in the automotive, photocopier and printer industries. They called this the holistic or rugby approach, as the whole process is performed by one cross-functional team across multiple overlapping phases, where the team "tries to go the distance as a unit, passing the ball back and forth". (In rugby football, a scrum refers to a tight-packed formation of players with their heads down who attempt to gain possession of the ball.)</p><p>In the early 1990s, Ken Schwaber used what would become scrum at his company, Advanced Development Methods, and Jeff Sutherland, with John Scumniotales and Jeff McKenna, developed a similar approach at Easel Corporation, and were the first to refer to it using the single word scrum. In 1995, Sutherland and Schwaber jointly presented a paper describing the scrum methodology at the Business Object Design and Implementation Workshop held as part of Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages & Applications '95 (OOPSLA '95) in Austin, Texas, its first public presentation. Schwaber and Sutherland collaborated during the following years to merge the above writings, their experiences, and industry best practices into what is now known as scrum.</p><p>In 2001, Schwaber worked with Mike Beedle to describe the method in the book Agile Software Development with Scrum. Its approach to planning and managing projects is to bring decision-making authority to the level of operation properties and certainties. Although the word is not an acronym, some companies implementing the process have been known to spell it with capital letters as SCRUM. This may be due to one of Ken Schwaber's early papers, which capitalized SCRUM in the title.</p><p>Later, Schwaber with others founded the Scrum Alliance and created the Certified Scrum Master programs and its derivatives. Schwaber left the Scrum Alliance in the fall of 2009, and founded Scrum.org to further improve the quality and effectiveness of scrum.</p></div>
scrum.master.value=<div> <p>Scrum is facilitated by a scrum master, who is accountable for removing impediments to the ability of the team to deliver the product goals and deliverables. The scrum master is not a traditional team lead or project manager, but acts as a buffer between the team and any distracting influences. The scrum master ensures that the scrum process is used as intended. The scrum master helps ensure the team follows the agreed scrum processes, often facilitates key sessions, and encourages the team to improve. The role has also been referred to as a team facilitator or servant-leader to reinforce these dual perspectives.</p><p>The core responsibilities of a scrum master include (but are not limited to):</p><p><ul><li>Helping the product owner maintain the product backlog in a way that ensures the project is well defined and the team can continually advance forward on the project at any given time</li><li>Helping the team to determine the definition of done for the product, with input from key stakeholders</li><li>Coaching the team, within the scrum principles, in order to deliver quality valuable features for their product</li><li>Promoting self-organization within the team</li><li>Helping the scrum team to avoid or remove impediments to their progress, whether internal or external to the team</li><li>Facilitating team events to ensure regular progress</li><li>Educating key stakeholders in the product on scrum principles</li></ul></p><p>One of the ways in which the scrum master role differs from that of a project manager is that the latter may have people management responsibilities while the scrum master does not. Scrum does not formally recognise the role of project manager, as traditional command and control tendencies would cause difficulties,[16] however, it is possible for scrum teams to work effectively with agile project managers, especially on large-scale programs</p></div>
scrum.pbacklog.value=<div><p>The product backlog comprises an ordered list of requirements that a scrum team maintains for a product. It consists of features, bug fixes, non-functional requirements, etc.\u2014whatever needs doing in order to successfully deliver a viable product. The product owner orders the product backlog items (PBIs) based on considerations such as risk, business value, dependencies, and date needed.</p><p>Items added to a backlog are commonly written in story format. The product backlog is what will be delivered, ordered into the sequence in which it should be delivered. It is open and editable by anyone, but the product owner is ultimately responsible for ordering the items on the backlog for the development team to choose.</p><p>The product backlog contains the product owner's assessment of business value and the development team's assessment of development effort, which are often, but not always, stated in story points using a rounded Fibonacci sequence. These estimates help the product owner to gauge the timeline and may influence ordering of backlog items; for example, if the "add spellcheck" and "add table support" features have the same business value, the product owner may schedule earlier delivery of the one with the lower development effort (because the return on investment is higher) or the one with higher development effort (because it is more complex or riskier, and they want to retire that risk earlier).[</p><p>The product backlog and the business value of each backlog item is the responsibility of the product owner. The size (i.e. estimated complexity or effort) of each backlog item is, however, determined by the development team, who contributes by sizing items, either in story points or in estimated hours.</p><p>Scrum advocates that the role of product owner be assigned. The product owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product. The product owner gathers input and takes feedback from, and is lobbied by, many people, but ultimately makes the call on what gets built.</p><p>Typically, the product owner and the scrum team come together and write down everything that needs to be prioritized and this becomes content for the first sprint, which is a block of time meant for focused work on selected items that can be accommodated within a timeframe. The product backlog can evolve as new information surfaces about the product and about its customers, and so later sprints may address new work.</p><p>The following items typically comprise a scrum backlog: features, bugs, technical work, and knowledge acquisition. Web development can entail confusion as to the difference between a feature and a bug: technically a feature is "wanted", while a bug is a feature that is "unintended" or "unwanted" (but may not be necessarily a defective thing). An example of technical work would be: "run virus check on all developers' workstations". An example of knowledge acquisition could be a scrum backlog item about researching Wordpress plugin libraries and making a selection.</p></div>
scrum.daily.value=<div><p>Each day during a sprint, the team hold a daily scrum (or stand-up) with specific guidelines:</p><p><ul><li>All members of the development team come prepared.</li><li>The daily scrum starts precisely on time even if some development team members are missing.</li><li>The daily scrum length is constrained (timeboxed) to fifteen minutes.</li><li>Anyone is welcome, although normally only the scrum team roles contribute.</li></ul></p><p>During the daily scrum, each team member answers three questions:</p><p><ul><li>What did I do yesterday that helped the development team meet the sprint goal?</li><li>What will I do today to help the development team meet the sprint goal?</li><li>Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the development team from meeting the sprint goal?</li></ul></p><p>Any impediment (stumbling block, risk, or issue) identified in the daily scrum should be captured by the scrum master, displayed on the team's scrum board, and someone agreed to be responsible for working toward a resolution outside of the daily scrum. No detailed discussions should happen during the daily scrum.</p></div>
scrum.smeeting.value=<div><p>At the beginning of a sprint, the team holds a sprint planning event:</p><p><ul><li>Select what work is to be done</li><li>Prepare the sprint backlog that details the time it will take to do that work, with the entire team</li><li>Identify and communicate how much of the work is likely to be done during that sprint</li><li>Four-hour time limit for a two-week sprint (pro rata for other sprint durations) </li></p></ul></div>
scrum.rmeeting.value=<div><p>At the end of a sprint, the team holds two events: the sprint review and the sprint retrospective.</p><p>At the sprint review, the team:</p><p><ul><li>Reviews the work that was completed and the planned work that was not completed</li><li>Presents the completed work to the stakeholders (a.k.a. the demo)</li></ul></p><p>Guidelines for sprint reviews:</p><p><ul><li>Incomplete work cannot be demonstrated</li><li>The recommended duration is two hours for a two-week sprint (pro-rata for other sprint durations)</li></ul></p><p>At the sprint retrospective, the team:</p><p><ul><li>Reflects on the past sprint</li><li>Identifies and agrees continuous process improvement actions</li></ul></p><p>Guidelines for sprint retrospectives:</p><p><ul><li>Two main questions are asked in the sprint retrospective: What went well during the sprint? What could be improved in the next sprint?</li><li>The recommended duration is one-and-a-half hours for a two-week sprint (pro-rata for other sprint durations)</li><li>This event is facilitated by the scrum master</li></ul></p></div>
scrum.team.value=<div><p>The development team is responsible for delivering potentially shippable increments (PSIs) of product at the end of each sprint (the sprint goal). A team is made up of 3\u20139 individuals who do the actual work (analyse, design, develop, test, technical communication, document, etc.). Development teams are cross-functional, with all of the skills as a team necessary to create a product increment. The development team in scrum is self-organizing, even though there may be some level of interface with project management offices (PMOs).</p></div>
scrum.sbacklog.value=<div><p>The sprint backlog is the list of work the development team must address during the next sprint. The list is derived by selecting product backlog items from the top of the product backlog until the development team feels it has enough work to fill the sprint. This is done by the development team asking "Can we also do this?" and adding product backlog items to the sprint backlog. The development team should keep in mind its past performance assessing its capacity for the new sprint, and use this as a guide line of how much "effort" they can complete.</p><p>The product backlog items are broken down into tasks by the development team. Tasks on the sprint backlog are never assigned; rather, tasks are signed up for by the team members as needed according to the set priority and the development team member skills. This promotes self-organization of the development team, and developer buy-in.</p><p>The sprint backlog is the property of the development team, and all included estimates are provided by the development team. Often an accompanying task board is used to see and change the state of the tasks of the current sprint, like "to do", "in progress" and "done".</p><p>Once a sprint backlog is committed, no additional functionality can be added to the sprint backlog except by the team. Once a sprint has been delivered, the product backlog is analyzed and reprioritized if necessary, and the next set of functionality is selected for the next sprint.</p></div>
scrum.sprint.value=<div><p>A sprint (or iteration) is the basic unit of development in scrum. The sprint is a timeboxed effort; that is, it is restricted to a specific duration. The duration is fixed in advance for each sprint and is normally between one week and one month, with two weeks being the most common.</p><p>Each sprint starts with a sprint planning event, the aim of which is to define a sprint backlog, where the work for the sprint is identified and an estimated commitment for the sprint goal is made. Each sprint ends with a sprint review and a sprint retrospective, where the progress is reviewed and shown to stakeholders and improving lessons for the next sprints are identified.</p><p>Scrum emphasizes working product at the end of the sprint that is really done; in the case of software, this would likely include that the software has been integrated, fully tested, end-user documented, and is potentially shippable</p></div>
